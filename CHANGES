Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Don't crash when a container where a user explicitly subscribed has
been removed.
- If an email address is empty it will be skipped when sending emails.
New internal features:
- #888 (event error while logging out from portal)
- use mtool.getEmailFromUsername instead of mtool.getEmailfromUsername

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use before commit hook ordering. EventManager will be called after
the IndexationManager
- Filter repo objects at push level so that they won't be processed at all
- CPSSubscriptions now will use the MembershipTools new method to get an email
  address instead of the getMemberEmail skin. The skin still exists for
  backwards compatibility, and also uses this method.
- Use the cps transaction manager to register the event manager hook
- EventManager implements CPSCore.interfaces.IBaseManager
