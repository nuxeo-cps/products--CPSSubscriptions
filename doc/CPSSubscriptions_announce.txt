CPSSubscriptions is a CPS3 product handling event subscriptions
and notifications.

Within CPS3, content is driven by several workflows and handled by
different actors depending on their rights at a certain time and
in a given context.  The workflow schemas within large scale
organizations can also be extremely complex.

It seems to be quite vital for portal actors to be informed when
they have to do something (validating, publishing, transmitting,
etc, ....) without having to lookup on the portal to find what
they need to do.

The main features of CPSSubscriptions:

- Subscriptions

  A subscription, within CPSSubscriptions, can be seen as a
  mailing list subscription. It is usually linked to a given event
  and portal members or visitors can be notified when this given
  event occurs by either subscribing or either having roles which
  are setup to notify on these given events by a manager. Or still
  being part explicitly of the mailing list. (Manager can add
  explicitly email to an event.)

- Notifications

  CPSSubscriptions can right now handle mail notifications, but it
  could be extended to handle SMS, Jabber or other notification
  systems, thanks to the architecture's modularity.

- An administration tool (portal_subscriptions) where the portal
  manager can monitor events, content of sent messages,
  subscribe-able context, etc...

It is also designed to be extended easily with custom workflows,
custom portal_types on CPS3-based project.
