CPSSubscriptions Release (0.6)
-------------------------------

$Id$

CPSSubscriptions is a CPS3 product handling event subscriptions and
notifications.

Within CPS3 content is driven by several workflows and handled by different
actors depending on their rights at a certain time and in a given
context. The workflow schemas within large scaled organizations can also be
extremely complex.

It seems to be quite vital for portal actors to be informed when they have
to do something (validating, publishing, transmiting, etc, ....) without
having to lookup on the portal to find what they need to do.

The main features of CPSSubscriptions :

  - Subscriptions

    A subscription, within CPSSubscriptions, can be seen as a mailing list
    subscription. It is usually linked to a given event and portal members
    or visitors can be notified when this given event occurs by either
    subscribing or either having roles which are setup to notify on these
    given events by a manager. Or still being part explicitly of the mailing
    list. (Manager can add explicitly email to an event)

  - Notifications

    CPSSubscriptions can right now handle mail notifications but it could be
    extended to SMS, Jabber or whatever notifications thanks the
    architecture modularity.

  - Administration tool (portal_subscriptions) where the manager can monitor
    events, content of sent messages, subscripable context, etc...

It is also designed to be extended easily with custom workflows, custom
portal_types on CPS3 based project.
