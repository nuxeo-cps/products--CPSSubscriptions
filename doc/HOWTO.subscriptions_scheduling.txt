What ?
-------

To request the CPS Portal to send mails according to the daily / weekly /
monthly subscriptions.

How ?
--------

Since Zope (CPS neither)  doesn't provide Scheduler (And I think this is
much more better like that...), you need to use crond to preform what's
above.

Configurations :
-----------------

You need wget installed on your *NIX to request the portal

Daily notifications :
-----------------------

Add within your /etc/cron.daily/ the following script.

cat <<'EOF' >portal_XXX_daily_subscriptions
#!/bin/sh
wget -q http://root:pwd_root@localhost:9080/cps/cps_subscriptions_schedule_notifications?subscription_mode=daily
EOF

Weekly notifications :
-----------------------

Add within your /etc/cron.weekly/ the following script.

cat <<'EOF' >portal_XXX_weekly_subscriptions
#!/bin/sh
wget -q http://root:pwd_root@localhost:9080/cps/cps_subscriptions_schedule_notifications?subscription_mode=weekly
EOF

Monthly notifications :
-----------------------

Add within your /etc/cron.monthly/ the following script.

cat <<'EOF' >portal_XXX_monthly_subscriptions
#!/bin/sh
wget -q http://root:pwd_root@localhost:9080/cps/cps_subscriptions_schedule_notifications?subscription_mode=monthly
EOF

I don't have any idea on how to do that with redmond's systems... sorry...
