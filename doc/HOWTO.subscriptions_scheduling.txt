What ?
-------

To request the CPS Portal to send mails according to the daily / weekly /
monthly subscriptions.

How ?
--------

Since Zope (CPS neither)  doesn't provide Scheduler (And I think this is
much more better like that...), you need to use crond to preform what's
above.

Configurations :
-----------------

Use the cps_housekeeping.py scripts that comes with CPS in folder CPSUtil/bin
adjust the default values in the header and run it as follows::

 $ python /path/to/cps_housekeeping.py --send-notifications daily

A crontab example is provided in the header of the script.

To get the list of all available options, type::

 $ python /path/to/cps_housekeeping.py --help

Otherwise, if you have wget installed on your *NIX to request the portal you
can directly call the corresponding method as follows.

Daily notifications :
-----------------------

Create a script in your /etc/cron.daily/ by issuing the following command:

cd /etc/cron.daily/
cat <<'EOF' >portal_XXX_daily_subscriptions
#!/bin/sh
wget -q http://manager:password_manager@localhost:8080/cps/cps_subscriptions_schedule_notifications?subscription_mode=daily
EOF

(Replace, if necessary, manager by the login name of a Zope user with manager
role on the CPS instance, password_manager by its password, and 8080 by the
actual port of your Zope instance, cps by the id of your CPS, and XXX by the
name of your portal).

and make sure that the script has execution rights 
('chmod +x /etc/portal_XXX_daily_subscriptions')


Weekly notifications :
-----------------------

Add within your /etc/cron.weekly/ the following script.

cat <<'EOF' >portal_XXX_weekly_subscriptions
#!/bin/sh
wget -q http://root:pwd_root@localhost:9080/cps/cps_subscriptions_schedule_notifications?subscription_mode=weekly
EOF

(Same remark as above).

Monthly notifications :
-----------------------

Add within your /etc/cron.monthly/ the following script.

cat <<'EOF' >portal_XXX_monthly_subscriptions
#!/bin/sh
wget -q http://root:pwd_root@localhost:9080/cps/cps_subscriptions_schedule_notifications?subscription_mode=monthly
EOF

(Same remark as above).
